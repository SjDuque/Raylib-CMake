# Raylib-CMake-Template

A simple template for using Raylib on any platform with CMake. This doesn't even require you to have Raylib installed on your system as the CMakeLists.txt will take care of installation for you if Raylib is not found.

The main.cpp file is from an example from www.raylib.com
The CMakeLists.txt is modified from https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/projects/CMake/CMakeLists.txt
